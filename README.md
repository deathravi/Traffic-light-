# Traffic-light-
Develop a Python program using OpenCV that processes video from camera/file and identifies traffic light states in real-time. Implement color-based detection with HSV color space segmentation and live visualization.
Use OpenCV for video processing and color detection. Implement HSV color space conversion for robust color segmentation. Add object validation using size/shape constraints. Display live feed with bounding boxes and labels.
